            <div><h3>Back-Ground</h3>
            <p>DaBaby was born Jonathan Kirk in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1991. By age six, 
            he'd relocated to Charlotte, and spent his adolescence engaged in street life.
             In December 2014, Kirk made a quick decision to become a rapper, taking the name Baby 
             Jesus and issuing his NonFiction mixtape a month later. Never having been on a stage before, 
             he headed to South by Southwest in the spring of 2015 and began making a name for himself with 
             his visceral live performances. Kirk changed his name to DaBaby, going so far as to explain the 
             "political reasons" for this decision in the lyrics to "DaBaby (Intro)," a short introduction to 
             2016's God's Work Resurrected, his first mixtape under the new moniker. This release featured
             a cameo from Boosie Badazz and began to attract the attention of fans and peers alike.</p></div>
